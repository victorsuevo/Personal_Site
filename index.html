<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
	<h3 id="h3">Created a scheduling control system for a pediatric clinic</h3>
	<p>The scheduling control system developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.doctoralia.com.br/fabiana-bortolini/generalista/rio-grande" target="_blank">Burtolini Pediatric Clinic</a> includes several essential features designed to streamline appointment management and enhance patient care. The code, written in Python with SQLite as the database, is structured to address the clinic's specific needs effectively. Here's an overview of its features and functionality:<br/>

		1. <b>Appointment Scheduling</b>: The system enables precise scheduling of appointments, preventing overlapping time slots. It supports emergency bookings that bypass the standard 30-minute interval restriction, ensuring flexibility during critical situations.<br/>
		
		2. <b>Patient Registration</b>: New patients can be registered effortlessly while avoiding data duplication, such as duplicate CPF entries. This ensures accurate and organized patient records.<br/>
		
		3. <b>Edit and Cancel Appointments</b>: Users can edit, cancel, or reschedule appointments directly through the interface, offering adaptability for last-minute changes.<br/>
		
		4. <b>Time Interval Control</b>: For non-emergency cases, the system enforces a 30-minute gap between appointments. This rule is overridden for emergency bookings to prioritize urgent care.<br/>
		
		5. <b>Appointment Display</b>: A user-friendly interface displays scheduled appointments clearly, with options to edit or cancel directly from the list.<br/>
		
		6. <b>Report Generation</b>: The system can generate CSV reports for administrative purposes, such as financial tracking and patient flow analysis.<br/>
		
		<p><strong> Implementation:</strong><br/><br>
			
	
		- <b>Database Management with SQLite</b>: The system uses SQLite for local data storage, handling patient and appointment information. Its simplicity eliminates the need for a complex database server while ensuring reliable data management.<br/>
		
		- <b>Table Structure</b>: 
		- Patients: Stores patient details like name, CPF, and age, with validation to prevent duplicate records.<br/>
		- <b>Appointments</b>: Records appointment details, including date, time, patient, and type (regular or emergency), ensuring no schedule conflicts.<br/>
		
		- <b>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</b>: Built using Tkinter, the interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Key components include:
		- Buttons for scheduling, editing, and canceling appointments, placed intuitively for quick access.
		- A Listbox to display scheduled appointments, allowing edits or cancellations directly.
		- Input fields for patient and appointment details, with validations to prevent errors or redundancies.<br/>
		
		- <b>Validation and Scheduling Logic</b>: The code validates appointment timings, ensuring they comply with interval rules unless marked as an emergency. Any scheduling conflicts are flagged for user correction.<br/>
		
		- <b>Editing and Canceling Appointments</b>: Users can seamlessly modify appointment details or remove bookings when necessary, streamlining administrative tasks.<br/>
		
		- <b>Report Export Functionality</b>: CSV report generation simplifies administrative workflows by providing insights into patient flow, financial data, and operational efficiency.<br/>
		
		- <b>Scalability and Maintenance</b>: Designed with adaptability in mind, the code can accommodate future enhancements, such as system integration, automated reminders, or expansion to multiple clinic branches.<br/>
		
		This system is designed to optimize the clinic’s workflow, reduce human error, and ensure a more organized and patient-focused environment. It allows the administrative and medical staff to concentrate on delivering quality care rather than dealing with logistical challenges.</p> <p>Click <a href="https://github.com/victorsuevo/Consulta" target="_blank">here</a> for more.</p>
